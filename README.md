# VIO - PhotonVision
This is a project that aims to improve FRC vision accuracy using Visual Odometry (VO) and similar methods

Things to accomplish:
- [x] Get custom pipeline running
- [needs debugging] Basic VO (look at https://github.com/thehummingbird/robotics_demos/blob/main/monocular_vo)
- [ ] Inertial odometry using pidgen and sensor fusion (look at https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/visual-inertial-odometry/)
- [?] Sensor fusion for physical odometry from RoboRiO
- [ ] Mesh based localisation? https://youtube.com/watch?v=vMsV04emXHU https://dlnext.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-031-20047-2_34
- [ ] Optimise and refine.
